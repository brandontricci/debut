    Enduring monument of the Power Divine!<br>
    Thy white-foam pillars ever moving stand,<br>
    And ever standing move harmoniously<br>
    To the rough music of the dashing spray,<br>
    And roaring tumult of thy boiling base. </p>
  <p>- From "Niagara Falls: A Poem in Three Cantos' by James K. Liston, 1843.</p>
  <p>Born around 12,000 years ago, Niagara Falls is a set of massive waterfalls located on the Niagara River, on the border between Canada and the United States.</p>
  <p> The Falls are comprised of three separate waterfalls: the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls, and the smaller, adjacent Bridal Veil Falls. The crescent-shaped Horseshoe Falls is also known as the Canadian Falls as it is located mostly on the Canadian side of the border.</p>
  <p> The residents of Niagara Falls were among the most passionate and vocal participants in the 7 Wonders of Canada project. After appearing on <a href="#" target="_blank">Sounds Like Canada</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">The National</a>, Westlane Secondary student Becky Puddicombe became a local celebrity, receiving a job offer from the <a href="#" target="_blank">Niagara Parks Commission</a> and the Key to the City from the mayor. One opinion piece in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Niagara Falls Review</a> newspaper compared the <a href="#" target="_blank">CBC</a>'s selection process to the 2004 presidential election in Florida.</p>
