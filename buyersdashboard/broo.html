                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurraw! Balm started out of pure intent; a personal obsession to create the perfect balm:
                    all natural, vegan, made from premium raw, organic and fair trade ingredients, </p><p>
                    complete with a bunch of natural and fun flavor options! It also had to meet some tough criteria... 

</p><p><h2>
Criteria: 
</p><p></h2>

Super smooth, not draggy, not sticky, not sweet, not too glossy, not too smelly, never grainy, long lasting; 
plus, it had to hold up to being in a back jeans pocket all day without melting! 
</p><p>
It took us several obsessed years to formulate Hurraw! Balm and put it through all the rigors.</p><p>
We love it, use it, and hope you do too. 
</p><p>
<h2>
Why Hurraw! is unique: 
</p><p></h2>
To ensure the quality and integrity of our product, we individually pour each tube of Hurraw! balm in our own facility.
Our top priority is to make Hurraw! the finest all natural, vegan, balm available... 
a great product to be used by everyone regardless of lifestyle. 
</p><p>
We source honest, fair trade, organic, vegan and raw ingredients from reputable suppliers and are thrilled to share the labors 
with other balm lovin' individuals. Your purchase supports legit fair trade, organic farmers and suppliers here in the States and around the World. 
</p><p>
<b>
Vegan: 
</p><p></b>
Hurraw! Balm is a Certified Vegan product. 'Vegan' means no animal products (ie: beeswax) are included in our product. 
We are proud to also be CCIC approved. The CCIC provides the leaping bunny logo which assures our cruelty free standards 
(no animals are used/harmed/tested on in any stage of the manufacture of our product, including our suppliers). 
</p><p>
 

<b>
Raw: 
</p><p></b>
Hurraw! Balm contains certified organic, cold pressed and centrifuged extracted, nut/seed oils and butters that have been processed 
below 118F degrees and are still chocked full of their essential nutrients and enzymes. Although more expensive, the quality of cold pressed 
oils and raw butters is superb; you'll feel the difference…your lips will be stoked! 
</p><p>
We gently warm our oils and butters separate from our candelilla wax (which melts at 155F). 
We combine them at a high speed which keeps the overall temperature very low. 
</p><p>
<b>
Organic: 
</p><p></b>
Hurraw! Balm contains certified organic ingredients, if you would like our supplier certificates, please contact us. 

</p><p><b>
GMO's: 
</p><p></b>
Not a chance. 
</p><p>

Gluten Free, Soy Free, Shea Free: 
</p><p>
The Tocopherols we use as a natural preservative is 100% derived from sunflowers (NOT soy, wheat or palm). 
Our balms do not contain any soy or shea butter (ie: latex allergy). 
</p><p>
<b>
Non toxic: 
</p><p></b>

No petroleum, parabens, preservatives, artifical flavors or colors. 
Did you know the shine in many lipsticks and glosses come from petroleum jelly (a bi-product of oil drilling linked to many health problems including cancer)?
A recent statistic showed that over the course of a decade regular users of lip products containing petroleum, can end up ingesting seven pounds of the stuff... </p><p>
essentially it's like drinking gasoline. Ugh. (source: www.doctoroz.com) 
</p><p>
<h2>
Our Core Ingredients: 
</p><p><b></h2>
Almond oil:</b>
Our 100% natural almond oil is pressed in California at a family-run mill from raw almond kernels. 
It comes direct to us right after pressing, allowing it to be super fresh and exceptionally rich in nourishing fatty acids. 
Great for your lips; almond oil moisturizes, softens, soothes, and re-conditions them superbly. 
</p><p><b>
Coconut oil:</p><p></b>
We use a raw, organic, fair trade coconut oil that has been extracted using a centrifuged method. 
This method gently separates fresh coconuts and allows a pure raw oil to be obtained. The result is amazing. Coconut oil is a fabulous moisturizer, 
a great free radical buster and super soothing for chronic lip inflammation. </p><p>
<b>
Cacao butter:
</p><p></b>
Our natural sourced, equitable trade cacao butter is pressed from the organic raw seeds of the cacao tree. 
Our rich, certified raw butter comes direct to us from small farmer owned lands in Bali. It will nourish, soften, soothe and moisturize your lips. 
Cacao butter not only improves skin elasticity but smells oh so divine. 
</p><p><b>
Jojoba oil:
</p><p></b>
Our organic jojoba oil is obtained farmer direct after being cold pressed in Arizona from simmondsia chinensis beans and is actually a "liquid wax." 
Jojoba oil's properties are very similar to our skin's own, allowing it to be a deeply absorbed, wonderful moisturizer for the lips. 
</p><p><b>
Olive oil: 
</p><p></b>
Cold pressed from a fruit and used for over 5000 years...no doubt olive oil is amazing! 
Our Californian grown olive oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins A & E; natural squalene properties moisturize, repair and protect your lips. 
</p><p><b>
Castor oil: 
</p><p></b>
A natural emollient from India, our organic, cold pressed, hexane free castor oil makes an excellent protective barrier against harsh conditions. 
Anti-inflammatory, healing, very soothing and deeply absorbed, it will help your lips stay soft and supple. 
</p><p><b>
Sesame oil (Dosha Balms): </p><p></b>
Cold pressed from tiny raw sesame seeds grown in Texas, sesame oil is super hydrating and penetrates quickly. 
It's full of awesome fatty acids to protect and nourish the lips. 
</p><p><b>
Candelilla wax: </p><p></b>
We use a very high quality candelilla wax that is sustainably wildcrafted from candelilla plants in Mexico. 
We combine this fabulous wax with our raw / cold pressed oils and butters to provide an excellent long lasting protective shield for your lips. 
</p><p><b>
Flavors: </p><p></b>
All of the flavors we use in our balms are derived from 100% natural sources. </p><p>
Most come from pure essential oils, the others (Rootbeer, Chai Spice, Chocolate, Green Tea, Black Cherry) are made for us from 100% natural,
organically derived flavor compounds through various processes of distillation and extraction. 
</p><p>
<b>
Infuse: 
</p><p></b>
Similar to steeping a good cup of tea, we infuse our oils with a variety of seeds, pods, fruit zests, barks and roots for flavor and natural color. 
It's not a quick process but we think it makes a better balm; those little black specks in the vanilla balm are real vanilla bean seeds. Yum! 

</p><p><b>
Oval Tube: 
</p><p></b>
Hurraw! Balm comes in an oval tube (USA made/BPA free) for one reason: so that it doesn't escape from the back jeans pocket like our round tubes used to... </p><p>
and it turns out we love applying Hurraw! "ovally!"
We are SO EXCITED!  We've worked for over a year with our tube manufacturer to try and get our oval tubes made from recycled plastic.
Our tubes now have up to 50% recycled content!   The landfill thanks us (and you!)</p><p>
These tubes are made exclusively for Hurraw! but our hope is using recycled plastics becomes easily attainable for all manufacturers using plastics.
</p><p><b>
Recyclable? 
</p><p></b>
Being an environmentally conscious company is important to us. We ship in recycled and recyclable corrugated packaging. 
Our wholesale packs are made from 100% post-consumer paperboard using 100% wind power.</p><p>
Our oval tubes are recyclable #5 plastic. We realize #5 is a tough one at times to recycle locally. </p><p>
Please check with your local recycling center about recycling plastics and if they don't recycle #5, encourage them to do so! 
</p><p>
Did you know that almost all screw on plastic bottle caps and prescription bottles are #5 plastic? There is a huge amount of #5 circulating and a big need for it's recycling. </p><p>
Preserve's "Gimme 5" program is awesome and they are making it easier then ever to recycle #5. http://www.preserveproducts.com/recycling/gimme5locations.html 
</p><p>
<b>
SPF balm? 
</p><p></b>
Our Sun balm contains zinc oxide and is 100% natural. It is independently lab tested (on humans!) to a rating of spf15. 
</p><p><b>

Shelf Life: 
</p><p></b>
Our balms are shipped fresh; most are less than one week old when they ship. They do not contain any artificial preservatives. 
We recommend using your tube of Hurraw! Balm within a year of opening (fyi, stability tests place expiration at 3 years 'on the shelf') and storing it between 40-72F (4-22C). 

</p><p><b>
Gift? 
</p><p></b>
We send our balms in a cotton tea bag and wrapped in cute brown paper with gift messages at no extra charge. 
In the notes section of your order, just let us know what you would like to say to the lucky receiver. 

</p><p><b>
Tea Bag? 
</p><p></b>
That little pouch your balm came in (if purchased direct from our site) is a reusable, unbleached cotton tea bag made here in the States from US grown cotton.</p><p>
*The dye we use to stamp our tea bags is food safe and permanent. </p>
