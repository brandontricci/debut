<h2>
Our History</h2></p><p>
 Purémedy, LLC has been around for a few years, but our 
secret formula has existed far longer.  Joseph Piquette, 
the owner's great grandfather, taught the family how to 
craft the healing salve a hundred and fifty years ago after a 
nearly fatal leg infection and third degree burn was 
miraculously healed by using it.  Purémedy has since 
created 21 products, each tailored to treat skin conditions
both gently and naturally.
</p><p>
The ingredients are pure enough to eat, as owner Joan 
Siegel has (on more than one occasion) demonstrated, 
choosing 100% organic or wild-crafted, food grade 
ingredients for her specialty salves. 10% of the profits are
tithed to organizations that promote healing for the planet.
</p><p>
The testimonials are incredible and the line has quickly 
gained a loyal following in many stores, clinics and doctors 
offices all around the country.

<h3>
Kevin Peake, CA       uses the Baby Skin Formula</h3></p>
<p>I'm an adrenaline junkie and am frequently getting bruised and cut up. Also being an actor, my cuts 
and scrapes don't always go over well in my profession and I'm constantly trying to figure out how to
get them to heal as quickly as possible or hide them. I had some cuts on my arms that look as if they 
were scrubbed with steel wool, from my Krav Maga training (Contact Combat) which would have 
normally taken about another 2 weeks to heal. A friend gave me the Purémedy baby skin formula to 
use and to my surprise 3 days later my cuts were completely healed!!!

<h3>
Gayle Rich-Boxman, OR       uses the Veterinarian Formula</h3>
<p>
I bought this product at a shop in Cannon Beach, OR. and am almost out of it and I've gotta tell you,
I think it's GREAT!!!  I have two dogs who occasionally have allergy issues, they're Golden 
Retrievers and that's pretty common to this breed.  What I didn't count on is that it would be so 
effective on my dog Josh's severe ear allergies/infections.  PLUS, he ended up with a large 
hematoma on his ear due to scratching.  I took him to the vet and he wanted to lance it and wrap 
Josh's head and put him through a lot of stress, pain and anxiety, all so that his ear wouldn't look 
like a "potato chip".  I asked the vet if I didn't do that, would he be in pain and he said no.  So, I 
decided to put the Puremedy on the inner flap and inside the ear instead because I figured it would 
ease the itchiness and low and behold, his ear is going down and looking much better!  Along with 
that, when he does have itchy ears-a lifelong issue for him - I put your product inside after cleaning 
his ears and it brings immediate results!  I did an experiment, using the vet's very expensive salve 
vs. Puremedy and I've gotta tell you, yours is better and natural, which is one of the biggest reasons
I decided to give it a whirl.  Originally, I bought it to use on my horse because she was getting bitten 
by a miniature donkey, but haven't had occasion to use it on her yet.  It will now be a standard item 
in healing department of my cupboard!  I'm looking at getting some of your facial cream for myself, 
too!  </p><p>
Thank you!</p><p>

I purchased the Puremedy Original drawing salve because the Dr. diagnosed me with CA-MRSA. I'd 
never heard of it. My thigh was swollen, purple,hard and hurting. Yuckie. He said I had the worst 
strain! I can't imagine how I got it. The antibiotics make me nauseated. The cream has eliminated 
the purple and the sore has healed. The leg is now back to it's normal color and soft again so I 
imagine the infection is almost, if not completely gone (3 days).

            When our son was three weeks old he had a horrible outbreak of baby acne/dermatitis/eczema on his face and ears.  His skin was very red and dry and it was causing him some discomfort.  We did not want to use any harsh products and opted to let nature run its course.  We were desperate for a natural product to help ease the itchiness associated with his irritated skin.  We tried Purémedy on the weepy spots and it really helped a great deal! He is now ten weeks old and his skin is clear, however we keep Purémedy on hand for any scratches or flare-ups.  I use Purémedy on my lips everyday as well.</p><p> Lindsay, CA </p>
