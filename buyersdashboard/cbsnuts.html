                 <h2>“Finally, natural hair care products that perform!”</h2></p>
<p>
When I had my first child, I experienced postpartum hair loss three months after delivery. For me, my long hair is ‘me’! When I was introduced to Conceived by Nature Restorative Rosemary, I noticed my hair was thicker and softer. I haws very excited to try this product since I try to only use natural hair and skin care. Before I knew it, my hair was stronger, healthier and seemed to be growing faster.
</p><p>
Now pregnant with our second baby, I still use it every other day. I’m addicted to how my hair grows, feels and smells. After feeling like my hair would never be the same, I’m thankful for this product…making my hair even better than before using it! I will have the ‘me’ back thanks to Conceived by Nature- Restorative Rosemary Shampoo and Conditioner!!

Conceived By Nature…from the makers of the Original Mane ‘n Tail
</h2></p><p>
Conceived by Nature finds its roots in Straight Arrow’s forty-year family tradition of manufacturing all of its own products.
</p><p>
Our company stands behind its formulas and their performance, adhering to strict quality assurances, guidelines and consistently meeting that same performance standard. Conceived by Nature® is a completely natural and organic hair care line. The story is simple…sourcing the world for the highest quality natural and certified organic components, we designed each shampoo and conditioner to be uniquely balanced for incredible performance, with fragrant aromas to provide a multi-sensory experience that leaves hair natural, healthy, clean and conditioned.
</p><p>
Today, general health and well-being are of utmost importance to many in the quest for staying fit and vital. Why should you treat your hair differently? Organic foods, alternative medicine and a holistic approach to exercise have certainly become more common in our everyday activities. Hair care is an integral part of our daily routines, and should be thought of as another approach to treating your body, mind and spirit with the respect and nurturing care it deserves. Conceived by Nature combines the finest synergy of essential oils, herbs, micro-enriched proteins, and other natural ingredients blended precisely to fortify and nourish hair, leaving it soft, strong and shiny.
</p><p>
It all starts with the integrity of the ingredients…the Conceived by Nature line combines the finest certified organic ingredients to create these unique blended formulas.
</p><p>
Shampoo formulas include corn, aloe vera, mandarin orange, grape fruit extract, corn silk, green tea, chamomile, kelp, honeysuckle, lavender, wheat protein, rosemary, mango and vitamins B5 and E. Conditioner formulas include all of the above plus enhanced moisturizers and strengtheners, fortifying, nourishing, moisturizing oils, including sweet almond, olive, coconut and shea butter. Both formulas create a noticeably luxurious feel that remains completely gentle for eyes and skin, as well as helping to keep colored-treated hair vibrant.
</p><p>
No synthetic fragrances are used in the Conceived by Nature products. Only selected and blended essential oils provide an uplifting aroma that invigorates the senses in a hot steamy shower. For the introduction, three intoxicating scents and unique formulas make up the Conceived by Nature line of coordinating shampoos and conditioners: Moisturizing Citrus; Nourishing Lavender and Fortifying Rosemary.
</p><p>
In addition, taking into account the way people feel about what’s in products today, it is equally important to know what is not in the products they use. Therefore, our formulas have no synthetic dyes, no silicones, including dimethicone; no mineral oils or petrolatum; no animal derived ingredients; no parabens or sulfates and no testing on animals occur in the line. The well-balanced blend of botanicals, vitamins, and other organic ingredients present an environmentally conscious beauty routine, while living up to performance expectations.

Discover for yourself what a truly natural and organic hair care experience feels like.
