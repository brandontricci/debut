Butter </b>opened its doors for business on September 4, 2007, restoring the nostalgia of fine home-made baked goods to Vancouver’s west side.
</p><p>
Butter is the vision of Rosie Daykin, an interior designer who has been baking up a storm ever since she was old enough to hold a wooden spoon.At Butter you will find all the yummy baked goods you remember from your childhood, made from scratch every day. We use only the best ingredients in everything we produce and take the greatest care to make sure that everything at Butter tastes as good as Mom would have made!
</p><p>
In September of 2012 the Butter Baked Goods Cafe opened at 4907 Mackenzie Street. With the move to a bigger home Butter is now able to offer a light breakfast and lunch as well as all the delicious baked goods we are famous for. We are open Tuesday through Saturday, 8:00am to 5:30pm. Start your day with one of Butter's delectable muffins or scones and one of the best coffees in town! Swing by for lunch and check out the chalk board to see what sandwiches, salads, soup or quiche are on offer.Everyday is a little different but always delicious. If you have any questions, would like to order a big ol' birthday cake or just want to say hello, give us a call at 604-221-4333.
</p><p>
The original premises at 4321 Dunbar Street has had a little spruce up and is now open as Butter's Tea Room. Quickly proving to be the sweetest little tea room ever,we hope you will come and join us under the chandeliers for tiers of little sandwiches, wee baked goods and Butter's own line of custom blended teas. The Tea Room is open Wednesday through Sunday, 11:00am to 6:00pm, taking reservations for seatings at 12:00, 2:00 and 4:00pm. We also offer a la carte lunch options for walk ins should space allow.
