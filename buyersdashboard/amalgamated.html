                        <p><h3>About the Amalgamated Sope Company</h3>
We are Jen and David Elden and we make beautiful, handcrafted, Organic and natural body care products, sustainably and responsibly in Whitefish, MT. that are essential for everyday life on Planet Earth, or any other planet, for that matter.</p><p><h3>
It Began with a Basket of Soap</p><p></h3>
Jen started making soap as gifts, and then started experimenting with formulas and recipes. One week she took a basket of Soap to the Whitefish Farmers Market and came home with a basket of vegetables and some money. Before long she was making batches of Sope in the Kitchen, with a booth at the Market and was selling “Sope” in local stores. In 2010 she partnered with her husband David and formed the Amalgamated Sope Company to bring Sope to the masses.</p><p><h3>
Keep it Simple</p><p></h3>
These words are at the core of our philosophy and guide our choices in what goes into our products and how we do business.</p><p><h3>
No Unpronounceables</p><p></h3>
Almost edible. That’s what we like to say about our stuff. Your skin is the largest organ of the body and what you put on your body is just as important as what you put in your body, so we make sure that all of the ingredients we use in our products are pure and simple with beneficial and therapeutic properties to help sustain you.</p><p><h3>
Local and Sustainable</p><p></h3>
We firmly believe that you should you know your farmer, so we grow the Comfrey and Calendula for our Salve on our Urban Farm. We source the Organic Safflower Oil used in our Sope directly from Farmer who grows it in Eastern Montana. We gather Arnica flowers from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near our home. Shea Butter is from a sustainable women's cooperative in Ghana and our Palm Oil supplier is a member of the Palm Sustainability Council.We get our 100% recycled boxes in Bozeman, MT. and the labels on our tins and bottles are printed here in Whitefish.</p>

                        <p>
Jen started making soap as gifts, and then started experimenting with formulas and recipes. One week she took a basket of Soap to the Whitefish Farmers Market and came home with a basket of vegetables and some money. Before long she was making batches of Sope in the Kitchen, with a booth at the Market and was selling “Sope” in local stores. In 2010 she partnered with her husband David and formed the Amalgamated Sope Company to bring Sope to the masses.
